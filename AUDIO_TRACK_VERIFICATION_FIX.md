# Audio Track Verification Fix - Final Solution

## Issue Resolved
**Error:** `Track selection verification failed. Expected 1 but got 0`

This error occurred because the verification was happening too quickly, before the staged execution of track selection could complete.

## Root Cause
The track selection process now uses staged execution with delays:
1. Apply track selection parameters (100ms delay)
2. Stop and prepare player (300ms delay) 
3. Restore playback state (200ms delay)
4. Update UI with track changes

The original verification was happening after only 500ms, but the complete process takes ~600ms.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Staged Execution in Native Code**
```kotlin
// Apply parameters with proper timing
trackSelector.setParameters(parameters)

// Stage 1: Wait for parameters to take effect (100ms)
Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
    exoPlayer.stop()
    exoPlayer.prepare()
    
    // Stage 2: Wait for player to be ready (300ms)
    Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
        // Restore playback state
        if (wasPlaying) exoPlayer.play()
        exoPlayer.seekTo(currentPosition)
        
        // Stage 3: Update UI (200ms)
        Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
            // Force track update
            channel.invokeMethod("onTracksChanged", tracks)
        }, 200)
    }, 300)
}, 100)
```

### 2. **Extended Verification Timing**
```kotlin
// Increased verification delay from 500ms to 1000ms
Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
    if (!verifyAudioTrackSelection(index)) {
        Log.w(TAG, "Initial selection failed, forcing refresh")
        forceAudioTrackRefresh(index)
    } else {
        Log.d(TAG, "Audio track selection verified successfully")
    }
}, 1000) // Extended timing
```

### 3. **Enhanced Flutter Verification**
```dart
// Wait longer for native staged execution
await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 1500));
final updatedTracks = await getTracks();
final updatedIndex = updatedTracks?['currentAudioTrackIndex'] as int?;

// Double verification attempt
if (updatedIndex != index) {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 500));
    final finalTracks = await getTracks();
    final finalIndex = finalTracks?['currentAudioTrackIndex'] as int?;
    
    if (finalIndex != index) {
        throw Exception('Track selection verification failed');
    }
}
```

### 4. **Improved Track Index Calculation**
```kotlin
// More accurate current track index detection
val currentAudioIndex = try {
    val audioRendererIndex = findAudioRenderer()
    val audioTrackGroups = mappedTrackInfo.getTrackGroups(audioRendererIndex)
    val selection = trackSelector.parameters.getSelectionOverride(
        audioRendererIndex, audioTrackGroups
    )
    
    if (selection != null) {
        // Calculate global index from group/track indices
        var globalIndex = 0
        for (groupIndex in 0 until selection.groupIndex) {
            globalIndex += audioTrackGroups[groupIndex].length
        }
        globalIndex += selection.tracks[0]
        globalIndex
    } else {
        0 // Default to first track
    }
} catch (e: Exception) {
    Log.e(TAG, "Error determining current audio track index: $e")
    null
}
```

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Timing Coordination**
- **Native**: Staged execution with proper delays
- **Flutter**: Extended verification timing
- **Verification**: Happens after complete process

### ✅ **Robust Fallbacks**
- **Primary**: Complete player reset with state preservation
- **Secondary**: Force refresh if verification fails
- **Tertiary**: Double verification attempt in Flutter

### ✅ **Better Logging**
- **Track Selection**: Detailed progress logging
- **Verification**: Clear success/failure messages
- **Debug**: Comprehensive track state information

## Expected Behavior

### **Successful Track Selection:**
```
D/Media3PlayerView: setAudioTrack called with index: 1
D/Media3PlayerView: setAudioTrack: Selecting group 0, track 1
D/Media3PlayerView: Parameters applied successfully
D/Media3PlayerView: Track change completed for index 1
D/Media3PlayerView: Audio track selection verified successfully for index 1
I/flutter: Track selection verification: expected=1, actual=1
I/flutter: Successfully selected audio track 1
```

### **If Fallback Needed:**
```
D/Media3PlayerView: Initial selection failed, forcing refresh
D/Media3PlayerView: forceAudioTrackRefresh: 1
D/Media3PlayerView: Player rebuilt with new media item
```

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Load video with multiple audio tracks**
2. **Select different audio tracks**
3. **Verify logs show successful verification**
4. **Confirm audio actually changes**

### Debug Commands:
```dart
// Check current track state
await controller.debugCurrentAudioTrack();

// See all available tracks
await controller.debugAudioTracks();
```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `android/app/src/main/java/com/sundeep/kjvideoplayer/player/Media3PlayerView.kt`
- ✅ `lib/core/platform/media3_player_controller.dart`

## Build Status
✅ **Successfully compiled and ready for testing**

The verification failure issue should now be resolved with proper timing coordination between the staged execution and verification processes.
