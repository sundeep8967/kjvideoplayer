# Audio Track Selection Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary
The original issue was "Failed to select track 1" error where audio tracks weren't changing despite successful selection logs. The root cause analysis revealed:

1. **Track selection parameters were being set correctly**
2. **Verification showed selection was applied (returns success)**
3. **But the actual audio output remained unchanged**

This indicated the player wasn't properly reinitializing with the new track selection - the core issue was that track selection wasn't forcing the audio decoder to restart with the new track.

## Files Modified

### 1. Android Native Implementation
**File:** `android/app/src/main/java/com/sundeep/kjvideoplayer/player/Media3PlayerView.kt`

#### Key Changes Made:

##### Enhanced `setAudioTrack()` Method:
- **Complete Player Reset**: Saves playback state, stops player, applies new track selection, restarts player, and restores state
- **State Preservation**: Maintains playback position and play/pause state across resets
- **Immediate Track Update**: Forces immediate UI update with new track selection
- **Proper Track Group Handling**: Correctly maps global track index to group/track indices

##### Added New Methods:
- `forceAudioTrackRefresh(index: Int)` - Completely rebuilds player with new media item for stubborn track changes
- `verifyAudioTrackSelection(index: Int): Boolean` - Enhanced verification with detailed logging
- `debugCurrentAudioTrack()` - Shows detailed info about currently selected audio track
- `debugAudioTracks()` - Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

##### Double-Verification System:
- First attempts normal track selection with complete player reset
- Falls back to full media item refresh if verification fails after 500ms
- Provides robust fallback for edge cases

### 2. Flutter Controller
**File:** `lib/core/platform/media3_player_controller.dart`

#### Key Changes Made:

##### Enhanced `selectAudioTrack()` Method:
- **Simplified Logic**: Streamlined validation and error handling
- **Verification**: Waits 500ms then verifies track selection was applied
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear error messages when track selection fails
- **Proper Exception Handling**: Throws exceptions with verification failures

##### Added New Method:
- `debugAudioTracks()` - Flutter method to trigger native debug logging

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Track Indexing**: Original code treated track groups incorrectly
2. **Wrong API Usage**: Using `DefaultTrackSelector.SelectionOverride(index, 0)` instead of proper group/track mapping
3. **No Player Refresh**: Track selection wasn't forcing player to reinitialize with new track
4. **Missing Verification**: No way to confirm track selection actually worked

### Key Improvements:

#### 1. Proper Track Group Mapping:
```kotlin
// OLD (incorrect):
DefaultTrackSelector.SelectionOverride(index, 0)

// NEW (correct):
DefaultTrackSelector.SelectionOverride(targetGroupIndex, targetTrackIndex)
```

#### 2. Player Refresh:
```kotlin
// Force refresh the player
exoPlayer.stop()
exoPlayer.prepare()
```

#### 3. Verification System:
```kotlin
// Verify selection after 500ms delay
Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
    val newTracks = getTracksFromTrackSelector()
    val newIndex = newTracks["currentAudioTrackIndex"] as? Int
    if (newIndex != index) {
        Log.e(TAG, "Verification failed! Expected $index but got $newIndex")
    }
}, 500)
```

#### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging:
```kotlin
private fun debugAudioTracks() {
    // Logs all track groups, tracks, and current selection
    // Helps identify track structure and selection issues
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Successful Track Selection Logs:
```
D/Media3PlayerView: setAudioTrack called with index: 1
D/Media3PlayerView: setAudioTrack: Selecting group 0, track 1
D/Media3PlayerView: setAudioTrack: Parameters applied successfully
D/Media3PlayerView: setAudioTrack: Verification - new index: 1
I/flutter: Successfully selected audio track 1
```

### Debug Output:
```
D/Media3PlayerView: ===== AUDIO TRACK DEBUG =====
D/Media3PlayerView: Renderer index: 1
D/Media3PlayerView: Track groups: 1
D/Media3PlayerView: Group 0 (2 tracks):
D/Media3PlayerView:   Track 0: English (en)
D/Media3PlayerView:   Track 1: Spanish (es)
D/Media3PlayerView: Current selection: SelectionOverride{groupIndex=0, tracks=[1]}
D/Media3PlayerView: =============================
```

## What This Fixes

✅ **"Failed to select track 1" error** - Now properly handles track selection  
✅ **Track indexing issues** - Correctly maps global indices to group/track indices  
✅ **Audio not changing** - Forces player refresh to apply new track  
✅ **Better error reporting** - Clear error messages when track selection fails  
✅ **Verification** - Confirms track selection actually worked  
✅ **Debugging** - Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting  
✅ **Robustness** - Handles edge cases and provides fallbacks  

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Load a video with multiple audio tracks**
2. **Open audio tracks dialog or music panel**
3. **Select different audio tracks**
4. **Verify audio actually changes** (not just UI)
5. **Check logs for verification messages**

### Debug Testing:
```dart
// Call this to see detailed track information
await controller.debugAudioTracks();
```

## Troubleshooting

If audio tracks still don't change:

1. **Check logs** for "Verification failed" messages
2. **Use `debugAudioTracks()`** to see track structure
3. **Verify track groups** have multiple tracks
4. **Check if video file** actually has multiple audio tracks
5. **Test with different video files** to isolate the issue

## Notes

- The fix includes a player refresh (`stop()` + `prepare()`) which may cause a brief pause
- Verification happens after 500ms delay to allow track change to take effect
- Debug logging can be disabled in production by removing `debugAudioTracks()` calls
- The solution is compatible with AndroidX Media3 latest APIs
