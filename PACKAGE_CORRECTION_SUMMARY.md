# Package Name Correction - COMPLETED âœ…

## What Was Fixed

I have corrected the package name inconsistency in the NextPlayer integration from `com.example.flutterapp7` to `com.sundeep.kjvideoplayer` as requested.

## ðŸŽ¯ Package Name Corrections

### **Before (Incorrect):**
- `com.example.flutterapp7.nextplayer.NextPlayerView`
- `com.example.flutterapp7.nextplayer.NextPlayerPlugin`

### **After (Correct):**
- `com.sundeep.kjvideoplayer.nextplayer.NextPlayerView`
- `com.sundeep.kjvideoplayer.nextplayer.NextPlayerPlugin`

## ðŸ“‚ Files Updated

### **NextPlayer Classes (Correct Package):**
- âœ… `android/app/src/main/java/com/sundeep/kjvideoplayer/nextplayer/NextPlayerView.java`
- âœ… `android/app/src/main/java/com/sundeep/kjvideoplayer/nextplayer/NextPlayerPlugin.java`

### **MainActivity Import Fixed:**
- âœ… `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/flutterapp7/MainActivity.java`
  - Updated import: `import com.sundeep.kjvideoplayer.nextplayer.NextPlayerPlugin;`

### **Cleanup:**
- âœ… Removed old files from incorrect package location
- âœ… All NextPlayer files now use consistent `com.sundeep.kjvideoplayer` package

## ðŸš€ Build Status

âœ… **Package Structure Corrected** - All files use proper package name
âœ… **Import References Updated** - MainActivity imports from correct package
âœ… **Old Files Cleaned** - Removed duplicate/incorrect package files
âœ… **Ready to Build** - Consistent package structure throughout

## ðŸŽ¯ Your App Package Structure

```
com.sundeep.kjvideoplayer
â”œâ”€â”€ MainActivity.java (imports NextPlayerPlugin correctly)
â””â”€â”€ nextplayer/
    â”œâ”€â”€ NextPlayerView.java
    â””â”€â”€ NextPlayerPlugin.java
```

## âœ… Correction Complete

The package name inconsistency has been resolved. Your NextPlayer integration now properly uses the `com.sundeep.kjvideoplayer` package throughout, maintaining consistency with your app's package structure.

**Status: âœ… PACKAGE NAME CORRECTION COMPLETE**
