  Future<void> switchAudioTrack(int trackIndex);
  Future<void> switchSubtitleTrack(int trackIndex);
  Future<void> enterPictureInPicture();
  Future<void> setGestureEnabled(bool enabled);
}
```

#### Gesture Integration
```dart
class NextPlayerGestureDetector extends StatefulWidget {
  // Implement NextPlayer's gesture system

}
```

#### Advanced Settings Panel
```dart
class NextPlayerSettings extends StatefulWidget {
  // Settings panel with NextPlayer features
